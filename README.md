webcamMode for Cisco CE endpoints (excluding DX)

 This script pins a full-screen selfview to the highest numbered output on the system
 (connector 3 on SX80/MX700/MX800, connector 2 on all other systems) so you can use it as a source
 for a webcam. Connect your HDMI capture device to the highest output and then use that
 as the webcam in your online meeting
  
 Currently compatible with CE 9.3 - for some reason it doesn't work right with 9.2
